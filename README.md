# Soma

Soma is comprised of seven shapes that can be fit together to make many differrent figures.  The primary figure is
a cube.  It's much easier to work with real blocks, but I looked at this SceneKit app as a challenge in user interface.

The app demonstrates the following features:
1. Combining pan gesture with standard camera controls
2. Combining pan and swipe gestures
3. Making it appear that gesures are attached to nodes
